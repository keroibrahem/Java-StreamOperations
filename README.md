## 📋 Operations Implemented

### 🔹 Basic Stream Operations
- Filter even numbers
- Find names by starting letter
- Convert strings to uppercase
- Sort integers in descending order
- Remove duplicates using `distinct()`

### 🔹 Intermediate Stream Tasks
- Count strings longer than 5 characters
- Find first matching element
- Check divisibility by 5
- Collect to Set
- Skip first N elements

### 🔹 Numeric Streams & Reductions
- Sum of integers using `reduce()`
- Maximum and minimum values
- Average calculation
- Product of integers
- Count positive numbers

### 🔹 Collectors & Grouping
- Group students by department
